The idea is to develop a car rental system whose environment would be like zoom cars but there would be no organizational hold on the cars, rather any individual whose car is idle for specific time period can give their car on rent. 
A user needs to login and provide when they would like to rent a car.
This app can be used for carpooling purposes.
